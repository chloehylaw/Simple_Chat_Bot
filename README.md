# ABOUT
Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!

## LEARNING OUTCOMES
You’ll get to know the basic syntax of Python and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.

## PART 1
**Description**
Digital personal assistants help people to drive cars, plan their day, buy something online. In a sense, they are simplified versions of artificial intelligence with whom you can talk.

In this project, you will develop step by step a simple bot that will help you study programming.

**Objective**
For the first stage, you will write a bot who displays a greeting, its name, and the date of its creation. First impressions count!

## PART 2
**Description**
The greeting part is great, but chatbots are also supposed to interact with a user. It's time to implement this functionality.

**Objective**
At this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot so that it can greet you by your name.

## PART 3
**Description**
Keep improving your bot by developing new skills for it. We suggest a simple guessing game that will predict the age of a user.

It's based on a simple math trick. First, take a look at this formula:

age = (remainder3 * 70 + remainder5 * 21 + remainder7 * 15) % 105
The numbersremainder3, remainder5 and remainder7 are the remainders of division by 3, 5 and 7 respectively.

It turns out that for each number ranging from 0 to 104 the calculation will result in the number itself. This perfectly fits the ordinary age range, doesn't it? Ask a user for the remainders and use them to guess the age!

**Objective**
At this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot. It will greet you by your name and then try to guess your age using arithmetic operations.

## PART 4
**Description**
Now you will teach your bot to count. It's going to become an expert in numbers!

**Objective**
At this stage, you will program the bot to count from 0 to any positive number users enter.

## PART 5
**Description**
At the final stage, you will improve your simple bot so that it can give you a test and check your answers. The test should be a multiple-choice quiz about programming. Your bot has to repeat the test until you answer correctly and congratulate you upon completion.

**Objective**
Your bot can ask anything you want, but there are two rules for your output:

the line with the test should end with the question mark character;
an option starts with a digit followed by the dot (1., 2., 3., 4.)
If a user enters an incorrect answer, the bot may print a message:

Please, try again.
The program should stop on the correct answer and print Congratulations, have a nice day! at the end.
